<p>The older I get the less trust I have in unconfident men.
</p>
<p>And women for that matter.</p>
<p>I remember the face of the unconfident from my younger years, </p>
<p>I remember seeing faces of two women discussing what to do with me next.</p>
<p>I listened as any good child does. </p>
<p>My mother would listen just as any other worried mother would.</p>
<p>This being the fourth time in the doctors office this month. </p>
<p>She hated it, </p>
<p>Sure more than I ever did. </p>
<p>I never realized that that look my doctor had wasn’t normal,
</p>
<p>That that look stemmed from a lack of confidence in me.</p>
<p>Or that me walking around the house angry. </p>
<p>so angry for no obvious reason, was from her drugs.</p>
<p>The doctor saying we can try this we can try that</p>
<p>She stuck to her script like a priest does to a bible, </p>
<p>Hoping to find something in there to fix all my problems.</p>
<p>Lucky for me my mother lost religion some 20 years prior.</p>
<p>She knew the bible wasn’t all healing, </p>
<p>Just as she left 20 years ago, she left that day but this time holding my hand.</p>
<p>She took me to a smart and confident woman the next day.</p>
<p>This time I didn’t see two women worried.</p>
<p>This time It was only my mother,</p>
<p>She was scared just like the day before.</p>
<p>She was sure this was a lifelong thing for her son.</p>
<p>That all that could be done was just so on so pain management. </p>
<p>The other woman wasn’t so sure.</p>
<p>She was confident to not manage the symptoms, but to subdue them.</p>
<p>She said dose reduction was needed. </p>
<p>I never heard that term before. </p>
<p>It wasn’t one more round of multiple steroids twice a day,</p>
<p>Or other drugs that may cause harm or make me more bloated than a float on thanksgiving morning.</p>
<p>But there was a light at the end of the tunnel,</p>
<p>And it was more clear than ever that it wasn’t a train like my mom thought.</p>
<p>I got better fast, </p>
<p>It wasn’t over night but eventually I could breathe clear again.
</p>
<p>A few months later I started leaving my asthma inhaler at home.</p>
<p>A year later I lost my inhaler.</p>
